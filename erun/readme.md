This repository saves codes of experiments for my bachleor thesis.

The thesis studies one greedy-algorithm-based load balancing scheme in datacenter networks,
that packets are firstly routed to the switches with the shortest queues.

Some codes are forked from https://github.com/NetSys/simulator and https://github.com/HKUST-SING/PIAS-NS2.
Thanks for these giants' shoulders. :)

(Also providing data in the evaluation of paper "Towards shorter task completion time in datacenter networks")
